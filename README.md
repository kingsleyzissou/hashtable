# hashtable
Book management system

The requirement of the project was to build a custom hashtable to manage a list of books and characters
that appear in the books.

The application makes use of an open addressing hashtable with quadratic probing to handle collisions. Additionally, the app uses
a custom merge sort algorithm and binary search to find elements.
